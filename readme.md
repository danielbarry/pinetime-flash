**NOTE:** This has been adapted from
[lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt)
in order to de-couple the awesome work on his OS work and flashing procedure.

The following is a bunch of scripts to allow the PineTime device to be flashed.
Currently supported devices:
